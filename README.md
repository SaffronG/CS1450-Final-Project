# CS1450 Final Project
 Conways Game of Life with a 2d visualization in the console

The Cell Automata class implements the members of ICell and Cell[,] to create a multidimensional array filled with the Cells that contain information regarding Life or Death.
Each cell is responsible for determining if it evolves by checking the currentFrame and then referenceing the previous one then setting the current to the new value.
